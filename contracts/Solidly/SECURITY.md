## Bug Bounty Program

Solidly has a Bug Bounty program to encourage security researchers to spend time studying the protocol in order to uncover vulnerabilities. We believe these researchers should get fairly compensated for their time and effort, and acknowledged for their valuable contributions.

### Rules

1. Bug has not been publicly disclosed.
2. Vulnerabilities that have been previously submitted by another contributor or already known by the development team are not eligible for rewards.
3. The size of the bounty payout depends on the assessment of the severity of the exploit. Please refer to the rewards [section](#rewards) below for additional details.
4. Bugs must be reproducible in order for us to verify the vulnerability.
5. Rewards and the validity of bugs are determined by the security team and any payouts are made at their sole discretion.
6. Terms and conditions of the Bug Bounty program can be changed at any time.
7. Details of any valid bugs may be shared with complementary protocols utilized in the ecosystem in order to promote ecosystem cohesion and safety.

### Classifications

- **Severe:** Highly likely to have a material impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds.
- **High:** Likely to have impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds.
- **Medium:** Possible to have an impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds.
- **Low:** Unlikely to have a meaningful impact on availability, integrity, and/or loss of funds.

### Rewards

- **Severe:** $20,000-$200,000
- **High:** $5,000-$20,000
- **Medium:** $1,000-$5,000
- **Low:** $100-$1,000

_Paid out in USD equivalent of USDC, DAI, or ETH._

Actual payouts are determined by classifying the vulnerability based on its impact and likelihood to be exploited successfully, as well as the process working with the disclosing security researcher. The rewards above represent the _maximum_ that will be paid out for a disclosure.

### Scope
